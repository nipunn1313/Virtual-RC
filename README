18-549 Embedded Systems Capstone Project

Virtual RC

Requires the OpenCV library (with the python wrapper). Instructions for
installing it on Ubuntu here:

https://help.ubuntu.com/community/OpenCV

Requires tons of libraries. At least(!):
	OpenCV 2.7 (anything before doesn't have BackgroundMOGSubtractor2)
	libboost1.46-dev
	libbost1.46-all-dev
	libpython2.7 (compiling from source is hard! Find the repo if you can
			and install using aptitude)
	cvbloblibs8.3 (need to compile from source. Compile with -fPIC (modify
				Makefile))

Compile in the top directory using make -j. game.py is the full game while
MOGBlob is the standalone tracker

TODO:
-Move code to separate files to keep our filesize down
-Add checks for calibration. Most importantly, have the game display where it
thinks the corners of the map are (put visual indicators in the track image).
-Add ability to detect too much noise. Perhaps automatically restarting the
tracker and webcam if necessary (with different settings).
-Add a better track (wider!) with some small curves.
-Flush out the game (start/finish, timing, items, prevent people from cheating)
